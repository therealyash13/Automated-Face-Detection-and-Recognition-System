1. Introduction
----------------
The Automated Face Detection and Recognition System presented in this project aims to automate the process of student attendance using deep learning algorithms. The system leverages a Deep-CNN HAAR cascade classifier, OpenCV, and Keras to accurately detect and recognize faces with a high accuracy rate of 90-92%. It includes a centralized MySQL database for efficient storage and management of real-time face images. The system also features an intuitive user interface built with Tkinter GUI for easy access and navigation.

2. Installation
----------------
To set up the Automated Face Detection and Recognition System, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`
- Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Usage
---------
The Automated Face Detection and Recognition System consists of the following components:

- Code Files: Contains the Python scripts for face detection, recognition, and database management.
- Input Files: Includes the input images or videos on which the system will perform face detection and recognition.
- DataSet: Contains the dataset used for training the deep learning models.

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Place the input images or videos in the Input Files folder.
2. Run the face detection and recognition script using the command: `python detect_recognize.py`
3. The system will process the input files, detect and recognize faces, and update the attendance records in the database.

4. Dataset
----------
The dataset used for training the face detection and recognition models is included in the DataSet folder. Please note that due to privacy and data protection reasons, the dataset provided here is a sample dataset. For optimal performance, it is recommended to collect and curate a larger dataset specific to your use case.
